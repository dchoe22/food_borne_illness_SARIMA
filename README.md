# Time Series Analysis on U.S. Foodborne Illnesses using SARIMA
This Jupyter notebook dives deep into the predictive analysis of foodborne illness data obtained from the Center for Disease Control and Prevention. The main objective is to assess the potential of the Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (SARIMA) model in forecasting these illnesses.

Contents:

1. **Introduction:**
   - Brief overview and goal of the SARIMA-based predictive analysis.
2. **Analysis Dataset:**
   - Insight into the dataset's origin, structure, and the specific columns of interest.
   - Data transformation techniques employed.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
   - Visual exploration of the data to discern trends, seasonality, and possible irregularities.
4. **Modeling:**
   - In-depth discussion on the SARIMA modeling approach, hyperparameters, and the chosen model specifications.
5. **Model Testing:**
   - Evaluating the model's forecast capabilities against test data.
6. **Accuracy Evaluation:**
   - A quantitative measure (MAPE) to gauge the model's accuracy.
7. **Conclusion and Recommendations:**
   - Final observations, the model's efficacy, and guidance for future endeavors.

Usage:
